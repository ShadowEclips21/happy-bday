            <h1>Michala being Michala</h1>

            <p>
                I think that my sister is one in the rest of the world. She helps me when i'm I dont understand, she does her best to be the best.   
            </p>
            <p>
                When Aliette hits me Michala stops her. When your sad she helps you, if you are nice she is nice back.
            </p>
            <p>
                If we find her down we go and help her. My sister helps even when help is not wanted, she will play hard but we keep playing.
            </p>
